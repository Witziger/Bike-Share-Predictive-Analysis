# Bike-Share-Predictive-Analysis

##### Project Overview:
To make comprehensive bike usage predictions, generally we took five steps to complete our regression analysis: 
1) Clean data. 
2) Analyze the validity of the initial regression model by reflecting on five major assumptions. 
3) Use boxplot of each discrete variables to illustrate the usage patterns. 
4) With respect to the Multicollinearity analysis in step 2 and R-squared analysis, we eliminate some redundant variables and add dummy into the model to generalize a sophisticated regression model for usage prediction. 
5) Based on the new regression model, we intepret the coefficient in the regression model and give some recommendations. 
For the purpose of concision, we hide the output chart in this report. The chart can be shown by deleting 'include=FALSE' at the beginning of every R chunk.
